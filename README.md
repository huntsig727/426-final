# 426-final

This is my COMP 426 Final Project, 'Fun With Films.' It is a silly little website that I created where I played with:

1) React, useState, useEffect
2) A Firebase User database for Sign-Ups/Log-in
3) Axios and requests from API's (I used 4 different API's from RapidAPI)
4) Light/Dark Mode
5) Autocomplete.

This was written in JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

Here is the link to the deployed app with Netlify: https://huntersigmund426final.netlify.app/
